# Credits

Many icons in `img/scalable` are based on the GNOME [icon development kit](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/icon-development-kit) (CC0).

# A note on SVGs

In order to reduce the size of the extensions, most SVGs in this directory have been optimized using [`svgo`](https://github.com/svg/svgo).
