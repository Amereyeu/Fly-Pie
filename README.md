# Contributing to Fly-Pie

Whenever you encounter a :beetle: **bug** or have :tada: **feature request**, 
report this via [Github issues](https://github.com/schneegans/fly-pie/issues).

We are happy to receive contributions to Fly-Pie in the form of **pull requests** via Github.
Feel free to fork the repository, implement your changes and create a merge request to the `develop` branch.

Developing a Gnome-Shell extension is not easy, as debugging possibilities are quite limited. One thing you should always do is to monitor Gnome-Shells output for error or debug messages produced by Fly-Pie. This can be done like this:

```bash
journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell -f -o cat | grep flypie -B 2 -A 2
```

## Branching Guidelines

The development of Fly-Pie follows a simplified version of **git-flow**: The `master` branch always contains stable code.
New features and bug fixes are implemented in `feature/*` branches and are merged to `develop` once they are finished.
When a new milestone is reached, the content of `develop` will be merged to `master` and a tag is created.

## Git Commit Messages

Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. __:tada: Add cool new feature__ instead of __:tada: Added cool new feature__).
It's a great idea to start the commit message with an applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit.
