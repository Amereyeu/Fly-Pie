**Fly-Pie** is an extension for GNOME Shell which lets you open _marking menus_ via keyboard shortcuts. _And — to the best of my knowledge — it is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj-uefp36Jk">first GNOME Shell extension with achievements</a>!_ :trophy:

You can use it to launch applications, simulate hotkeys, open URLs and much more.
It features a continuous learning curve which lets you gradually lift-off from a grumpie menu rookie to a snappie menu pielot.
(You got it? Like pilot, but with a :cake:).
Once you opened a marking menu, you can seamlessly transition between three alternative selection modes:

<a href="https://youtu.be/j9t7hfkE_5w"><img align="right" width="350px" src ="docs/pics/player5.jpg" /></a>

* **Point-and-Click:** Select items by clicking on them or anywhere in the corresponding wedges.
* **Marking-Mode:** Select items by drawing gestures. To do this, click anywhere and drag your mouse. Pausing or making a turn selects the currently dragged item.
* **Turbo-Mode:** You can also "draw" gestures while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, or <kbd>Alt</kbd> _without having to press your mouse button_! This is especially useful when you opened the menu with a shortcut involving such a modifier.

Fly-Pie is designed for you **if you have one hand at the mouse** most of the time.
It is _not_ designed to be used with a keyboard only; there are other
applications which work better in this case (for example [kupfer](https://github.com/kupferlauncher/kupfer)).
Fly-Pie also works nicely with **touch input**.
