# About Fly-Pie

Fly-Pie is designed for people who have **one hand at the mouse** most of the time.
It is **not** designed to be used with a keyboard only; there are other
applications which work better in this case (for example [kupfer](https://github.com/kupferlauncher/kupfer)).
Fly-Pie will also play nicely with **touch input**.
While it might work already, a future version of Fly-Pie will be dedicated to
add proper touch support.
