- [ ] I followed the "Translating FlyPie" section of the README.
- [ ] I complied to the Contributing Guidelines. <!--see CONTRIBUTING.md-->
- [ ] I made the following changes to my `<LANGUAGE>.po` file: <!--You'll find most of them in the first code block, around lines 1-20-ish.-->
  - [ ] Fill in the `<LANGUAGE>`.
  - [ ] In case you are the first translator, fill in your info and the year. If not, just tick this box anyway.
  - [ ] Set `PO_Revision-Date` to an appropriate point in time.
        <!--It doesn't have to be accurate to the second, but at least the hour should be accurate.-->
  - [ ] Set `Last-Translator` accordingly.
        <!--Format: Firstname Lastname <my@email.address>.
        Alternatively, use your GitHub handle.-->
  - [ ] Update `Language-Team`. If your name is already on there, just tick this box anyway.
        <!--Please place your full name or GitHub handle at the end of the comma-seperated list.-->
  - [ ] Set `Language` to the language code (`de_DE`, `en_GB`) or just the country code (`de`, `en`).
        <!--If there are special words that are written differently in two countries with the same
        language (e. g. "color" and "colour" in English), the first variant is obligatory.-->
  - [ ] Make sure that `charset` is set to `UTF-8`.
        <!--This allows for special characters like √§, √∂, √º, √® etc. to be displayed correctly.-->
