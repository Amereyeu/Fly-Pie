## Requirements to get this PR accepted

Look at existing translations for reference. Even if your PR doesn't meet all requirements
right now, please do submit it anyways! We are a friendly community and eager to help you out.

- [ ] I followed the "Translating FlyPie" section of the README.
- [ ] I complied to the Contributing Guidelines. <!--see CONTRIBUTING.md-->
- [ ] I tested the translation and checked that nothing looks out-of-place.
      Especially the strings which are marked with **Keep this short** may break the layout of
      the user interface if the translation is too long.
      <!--When using Poedit or Gtranslator, keep an eye on the comments on the right hand side of the UI!-->
- [ ] I made the following changes to my `<LANGUAGE_CODE>.po` file:
      <!--You'll find most of them in the first code block, around lines 1-20-ish.-->
  - [ ] Fill in the `<LANGUAGE>`.
  - [ ] I added myself to the contributors list.
        <!--Please place your full name and email address or GitHub handle at
        the end of the first block of comments in the translations file, like this:
        <Firstname Lastname <emailOrGithubHandle>, <YEAR>.>
        This will be used to notify you when a translation needs to be updated (for opt-out, see below).-->
  - [ ] Set `PO_Revision-Date` to an appropriate point in time.
        <!--It doesn't have to be accurate to the second, but at least the hour should be accurate.-->
  - [ ] Set `Last-Translator` accordingly.
        <!--Format: Firstname Lastname <my@email.address>.
        Alternatively, use your GitHub handle.-->
  - [ ] Set `Language` to the language code (`de_DE`, `en_GB`) or just the country code (`de`, `en`).
        <!--If there are special words that are written differently in two countries with the same
        language (e. g. "color" and "colour" in English), the first variant is obligatory.-->
  - [ ] Make sure that `charset` is set to `UTF-8`.
        <!--This allows for special characters like ä, ö, ü, è etc. to be displayed correctly.-->

## Additional ideas/questions

<!--
This is the place for any additional stuff concerning your Pull Request.
For example, you could drop a note here if you do not want to get notified
when your translation needs an update in the future.
If there isn't anything else to say, please delete the heading.

Thanks again for your contribution!
Your Fly-Pie Team
